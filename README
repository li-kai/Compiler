This package aims to provide basic code so that students can work on
the third project assignment, which is to compile jlite programs to
ARM assembly code.

The package contains Ocaml codes that handles the front end of the
compiler for jLite programs.

The main program for this package is 
		jlite_main.ml

It makes use of the data structure file "jlite_structs.ml" to construct
parse trees, and "ir3_structs.ml" to construct "ir3" intermediate three-address
code. Lastly, it provides the data sturture file "arm_structs.ml" to
construct the assembly code. 

There are some test cases available in the directory "armTests". In this
directory, we provide the test cases (files end with extension "j"), and
sample compiled assembly codes (files end with extension "s"). However,
please note that the assembly code you produce will definitely be
different from these codes.
