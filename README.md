# Pja3 compiler optimisation

## Project Structure

The main program for this package is jlite_main.ml.

It makes use of the data structure file "jlite_structs.ml" to construct parse trees, and "ir3_structs.ml" to construct "ir3" intermediate three-address code.

Lastly, it provides the data sturture file "arm_structs.ml" to construct the assembly code.

## Commands

To compile the project, run

```bash
make
```

To run unit tests, run

```bash
make unit
```

To remove compiled files, run

```bash
make clean
```

To run the compiled code, download the docker image and run it by

```bash
docker pull falconets/pja3
# Assumes pwd = /pja3 folder
docker run -d -it --name proj --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/usr/local/src/pja3 falconets/pja3:latest
```

To access the docker container to run the arm code

```bash
docker exec -it proj /bin/bash
# after accessing bash
make run
```


## How it works

The sequence of constructing the compiler is through the following steps

1. Basic block construction
1. Flow graph
1. Liveness analysis
1. Global liveness analysis
1. Peephole
1. Register Allocation
1. Arm generation



## Optimizations


### Register Allocation

As modern cpus have registers that are magnitudes of difference with optimised allocation.

We use a special form of register allocation known as linear scan, following [the 1999 paper](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/suresh/502-Fall2008/papers/linear-scan.pdf) regarding the algorithm.


Register allocation to variables in a single linear-time scan of
the variablesâ€™ live ranges. The linear scan algorithm is considerably faster than algorithms based on graph coloring, is simple to implement, and results in code that is almost as efficient as that obtained using more complex and time-consuming register allocators based on graph coloring.


### Peephole Optimization: 
Eliminating use of temporary variables.
Strength reduction replaces a more expensive operator by a cheaper one example 


```ocaml
2 * X = X + X
```
Constant folding evaluate constant expressions at compile time and replace the 
constant expressions by their value.


## To enable all optimizations

```bash
# after make run
./jlite main [option] armTests/simple.j
```

-O    Enable all optimizations

## Notes

There are some test cases available in the directory "armTests". In this directory, we provide the test cases (files end with extension "j"), and sample compiled assembly codes (files end with extension "s"). However,
please note that the assembly code you produce will definitely be different from these codes.
